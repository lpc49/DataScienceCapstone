# DataScienceCapstone

This repo contains the notebooks and scripts completed under the 'IBM data science by Coursera' certification's final project, including the 7 steps of data science methodology as well as a python script of the bash webapp developped for visualization purposes.

I do not claim ownership in any way as the notebooks were pre-completed the context of the certification. 
However I believe it shows a good picture of the data science and coding techniques I learned through the courses.
Do let me know if you have any feedback!
